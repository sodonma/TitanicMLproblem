# TitanicMLproblem

The Titanic ML problem is an introduction problem given to people learning to use Machine Learning algorithms. This is my first attempt at completing the problem using my current skills and knowledge.

I completed the initial problem as a binary classification with the SciKit library. I was able to get about 85% accuracy. After comparing it to a few others, I found this to be an acceptable first attempt with my limited knowledge. I will reevaluate this problem once I have learned more.
